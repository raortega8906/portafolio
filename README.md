# Portfolio

This was the first portfolio I created, and the interesting aspect of this project is the admin panel developed in Laravel for managing projects with a full CRUD, which feeds data to the website for display.

### Objectives
* The main objective is to use Laravel to create an admin panel for managing projects.
